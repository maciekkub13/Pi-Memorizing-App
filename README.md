Hey,
This is my first project, and it took me about 4 hours to do it.
I created the App mostly for me, so i could learn to remember 100
pi letters(btw if anyone's interested here's the method: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI96Ph-yHcA)

So, if you're interested and after you've watched the video you should know what im 
talking about now. In the "pi.js" file on line 20,29,41 you need to change the string values
for your memorized words, and the app will work just great:) also, you must include the space on
line 3 and 20 after the string starts=) Gl!
